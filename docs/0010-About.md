About this text
===============

This cookbook was originally made for [Dr. Eitel J.M. Lauria's](http://www.marist.edu/compscimath/facviewer.html?uid=60) class. The aim is to teach students how to use [IBM's Cognos Express](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/express/) (v10.1.0) in an intuitive way with almost 300 images. Each recipe contains a:

- Problem: what needs to be done.
- Solution: full step-by-step of how it can be done.
- Do-it-yourself: different problem with a similar solution for a different data set.

Assumption
----------

This cookbook assumes you know what is a relational database, star schema, normalization, data warehousing, OLAP, ROLAP, MOLAP, etc. This only explains how Cognos works, how to use it, and how it relates to those concepts.

Data Sets
---------

The data sets are back ups of SQL Server databases. After downloading, you need to restore them.

- The problems and solutions are based on [foodmart-reduced](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8bnF9QulzZgU0tUcWJzMENjUjA)
- The Do it yourself are based on [foodmart 2008](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8bnF9QulzZgUnVLY3ljQW9fbkE)
